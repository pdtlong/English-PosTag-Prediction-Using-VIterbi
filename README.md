# Part of Speech (POS) tagging with Hidden Markov Model using Viterbi algorithm

**Part-of-Speech (POS)** _(noun, verb, and preposition)_ can help in understanding the meaning of a text by identifying how different words are used in a sentence. POS can reveal a lot of information about neighbouring words and syntactic structure of a sentence.

**The Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** is a statistical model for modelling generative sequences characterized by an underlying process generating an observable sequence. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which are probabilistic sequence models.
